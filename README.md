# SOM-gif-demo

This is a demo page of training a SOM (Self Organizing Map) algorithm to model a probability distribution of pixels in an image of a corgi. I took a screenshot at each step of the training process (~5000 of them in total), and composed them together to form 4 short videos. I used the great pyERA library from Massimiliano Patacchiola.
